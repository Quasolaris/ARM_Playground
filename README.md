# ARM_Playground
A repository where I document and share my adventure of learning ARM assembly and get to know different chips.

## Roadmap
To first get a hang of ARM assembly I will work through the book called [Programming with 64-Bit ARM Assembly Language](https://github.com/Apress/programming-with-64-bit-ARM-assembly-language), the examples and exercises I will code on a Raspberry PI 4 with 8GB of RAM. After the completion of this book I plan to go into the RP2040 (Raspberry PI Pico) with the Dual-Core ARM Cortex M0+ processor. On the side, I plan to work through the book [ARM Assembly, Internals & Reverse Engineering](https://leg-assembly.com/), and I will use this opportunity to use Ghidra and get to know it better. 

## Raspberry PI 4
